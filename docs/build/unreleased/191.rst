    Reworked the means by which values are serialized and deserialized from
    backends, and provided for custom serialization of values.  Added the
    :paramref:`.CacheRegion.serializer` and
    :paramref:`.CacheRegion.deserializer` parameters which may be set to any
    serializer.

    Serialization and deserialization now take place within the
    :class:`.CacheRegion` so that backends may now assume string values
    in all cases.  This simplifies the existing backends and also makes
    custom backends easier to write and maintain.

    Additionally, the serializer is now applied to the user-defined value
    portion of the :class:`.CachedValue` and not to the metadata or other
    portions of :class:`.CachedValue` object itself, so the serialized portion
    is effectively a "payload" within the larger :class:`.CachedValue`
    structure that is passed as part of the larger string format.  The overall
    format is a separate JSON of the cached value metadata, followed by the
    serialized form.  This allows for end-user serialization schemes that are
    hardwired to the values themselves without the need to serialize dogpile's
    internal structures as well.

    Existing custom backends should continue to work without issue;  they
    now have the option to forego any separate serialization steps, and
    can also subclass a new backend :class:`.BytesBackend` that marks them
    as a backend that only deals with bytes coming in and out; all
    internal serialization logic from such a backend can be removed.
