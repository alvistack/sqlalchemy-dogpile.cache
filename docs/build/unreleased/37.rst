    Added new method :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_value_metadata` which can be used
    to get a value from the cache along with its metadata, including timestamp
    of when the value was cached.  The :class:`.CachedValue` object is returned
    which features new accessors to retrieve cached time and current age. Pull
    request courtesy Gr√©goire Deveaux.
