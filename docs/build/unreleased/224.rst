    :tags: bug, memcached
    :tickets: 224

    Moved the :paramref:`.MemcacheArgs.dead_retry` argument and the
    :paramref:`.MemcacheArgs.socket_timeout` argument which were
    erroneously added to the "set_parameters",
    where they have no effect, to be part of the Memcached connection
    arguments :paramref:`.MemcachedBackend.dead_retry`,
    :paramref:`.MemcachedBackend.socket_timeout`.
